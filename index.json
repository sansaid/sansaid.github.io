I never quite knew what was worth bragging about to get me recognised.\nMany of you may recognise this behaviour.

      "content_text": "How do you ensure systems remain consistent even when a partial network failure happens between them? Seems impossible, right?\nA common approach would delegate a leader in a system, whereby all nodes would send changess to the leader first. The leader is then responsible for propogating the changes to all replicas. This approach is simple but can be slow, since the messages have to traverse a network. In the event of a network partition, your system may end up with a split brain with inconsistent data across the partition.",

It offers the ability to search for multiple words across multiple documents, otherwise known as a conjunction. How is Lucene able to quicklyperform these conjunctions?This is where the leapfrog algorithm comes in. The leapfrog algorithm is used to find word conjunctions across several documents. Before we dive into how this algorithm works, we should explain a few things first:",
