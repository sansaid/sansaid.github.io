      "content_text": "Apache Lucene is an open source search software used by many tech giants, including Twitter and LinkedIn to power their sites' search features. It offers the facility to be able to search for terms across various documents. But when you query for multiple words across several documents (otherwise known as a conjunction), how is Lucene able to quicklyfind which documents ALL of these words are contained in?\nThis is where the leapfrog algorithm comes in.",
