      <description>Businesses laying off seems to be tied to AI (see Discord post on 11/01/2024 on #tech-support) This is a flawed assumption Many businesses laying off to help with profitability So do you really believe that cutting down on AI will reduce your expenditure that much?  Some businesses have a large chunk of its revenue in ads Many businesses don&amp;rsquo;t want to admit this is a problem Relying on ads is a quick way to make money in lieu of a differentiating revenue stream Your business is then in the business of advertising - you&amp;rsquo;re not a tech company, you&amp;rsquo;re a marketing company So why is this so common?</description>

      <description>This paper from 2017 suggests that Cassandra is faster at writes at high throughput, and even outperforms Redis at the 0.1m to 1m writes scale. Why is that? How come Redis gets faster after 1m writes?</description>

      <description>Something about how difficult it is to bootstrap, including with oapi-codegen, despite the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to make it easier.
Use this to start a series about rating tooling with:

      <title>Fast refreshing files on Windows when running React on WSL</title>

      <description>I ran into some trouble where I fast refresh stopped working when I ran a devcontainer on Windows. If I mounted my devcontainer on a Windows file path, fast refresh stopped working; however, if I mounted the devcontainer on a path in WSL 2, React fast refresh did work.
First of all, running a devcontainer on the Windows filesystem with WSL 2 negatively impacts performance. Running the React development server in the devcontainer when mounted to a WSL 2 path was so much faster than on Windows (a few seconds vs 2 mins) - so there is at least that benefit.</description>

      <title>The Diversity Paradox</title>

      <description>Write something about how people who are minorities get asked to do glue work because they&amp;rsquo;re the only ones with insight into hiring minorities; but this means that they do not focus enough on engineering.
Similarly, in economic crises, diversity driven events are the first to be sacrificed and minorities (or women) are the first to suffer (explain why).
