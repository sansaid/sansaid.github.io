<li>Businesses laying off seems to be tied to AI (see Discord post on 11/01/2024 on #tech-support)</li>
<li>This is a flawed assumption</li>
<li>Many businesses laying off to help with profitability</li>
<li>So do you really believe that cutting down on AI will reduce your expenditure that much? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>Some businesses have a large chunk of its revenue in ads</li>
<li>Many businesses don&rsquo;t want to admit this is a problem</li>
<li>Relying on ads is a quick way to make money in lieu of a differentiating revenue stream</li>
<li>Your business is then in the business of advertising - you&rsquo;re not a tech company, you&rsquo;re a marketing company</li>
<li>So why is this so common?</li>
<li>Tangibility - people are more reluctant to pay for digital content because it&rsquo;s not a physical product (anecdotal, but this is evidenced by friends exclaiming about me paying £4 for a movie on Prime, where as we easily pay £11 each to go to the cinema) <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re interested in making money from a product you&rsquo;re good at making, then we need to solve the problem of paying for tech</li>
<li>Maybe one way of doing this is by making the payment invisible (if it&rsquo;s not real, then maybe pay for it &ldquo;not real&rdquo; currency) - look at how Gympass works, maybe we can do something similar</li>
