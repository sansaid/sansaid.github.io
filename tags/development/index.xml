      <description>I ran into some trouble where I fast refresh stopped working when I ran a devcontainer on Windows. If I mounted my devcontainer on a Windows file path, fast refresh stopped working; however, if I mounted the devcontainer on a path in WSL 2, React fast refresh did work.
First of all, running a devcontainer on the Windows filesystem with WSL 2 negatively impacts performance. Running the React development server in the devcontainer when mounted to a WSL 2 path was so much faster than on Windows (a few seconds vs 2 mins) - so there is at least that benefit.</description>
