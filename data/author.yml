  <p>
    I don't enjoy the process of writing a public-facing piece of text, so I started a blog.
    
    All of these blog posts were started because I didn't know how to answer the title. You'll often find just the title, with a headline "she still doesn't know" if I haven't figured out the answer to the question yet. At some point, I'd love to graph my journey, so maybe if you come back later, you might see a tidy visual of my attempts to learn.
