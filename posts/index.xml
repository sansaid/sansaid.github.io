      <description>Apache Lucene is an open source search software used by [TODO]. It offers the facility to be able to search for terms across various documents. But when you query for multiple words across several documents (otherwise known as a conjunction), how is Lucene able to quicklyfind which documents ALL of these words are contained in?
This is where the leapfrog algorithm comes in. The leapfrog algorithm is used to find word conjunctions across several documents.</description>
