      <description>We built our own patio. Applause. The sin of not having a DIY dad on either my or my partner&amp;rsquo;s side meant we accrued many mistakes. Even Google couldn&amp;rsquo;t prepare us. If you&amp;rsquo;re one of those people who&amp;rsquo;d like to ask me &amp;ldquo;what advice do you have?&amp;rdquo;, here&amp;rsquo;s my letter to you:
Lesson 1: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, ASK YOUR TILE SUPPLIER THE WEIGHT OF YOUR TILES We were advised to stay away from laying porcelain or ceramic tiles (very sound advice indeed), because they&amp;rsquo;re expensive and are more prone to cracking if you make mistakes elsewhere.</description>

      <description>Something that&amp;rsquo;s always plagued my career is my silence about my achievements.
Despite being a loud and outgoing person in my personal life, sometimes to the point of being a show off, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t translate to my professional life. I never quite knew what was worth bragging about to get me recognised.
Many of you may recognise this behaviour. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to brag about your work, maybe for one of the following reasons:</description>

      <title>The difference between operational transformations (OTs) and CRDTs</title>

      <description>How do you ensure systems remain consistent even when a partial network failure happens between them? Seems impossible, right?
A common approach would delegate a leader in a system, whereby all nodes would send changess to the leader first. The leader is then responsible for propogating the changes to all replicas. This approach is simple but can be slow, since the messages have to traverse a network. In the event of a network partition, your system may end up with a split brain with inconsistent data across the partition.</description>

      <title>How Lucene performs searches over word conjunctions</title>

      <description>Apache Lucene is an open source search software used by many tech giants, including Twitter and LinkedIn to power their sites&#39; search features. It offers the ability to search for multiple words across multiple documents, otherwise known as a conjunction. How is Lucene able to quicklyperform these conjunctions?This is where the leapfrog algorithm comes in. The leapfrog algorithm is used to find word conjunctions across several documents. Before we dive into how this algorithm works, we should explain a few things first:</description>
