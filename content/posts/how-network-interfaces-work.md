## Questions

* What exactly are they?
* Are they a hardware device or can it be virtualised?
* If it's virtualised, how can I create my own?
* How do network sockets relate to a network interface?
* Is the stuff that I wrote in the 20211228 time note correct?

## Notes

* On the 20211228 time note, I wrote some initial notes about them
