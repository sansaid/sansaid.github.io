It used to be a lot easier to learn when all we had were expostional texts. The type of media we could learn from were limited, and as a result, we didn't need to learn many ways of learning.

If you had a text book, all you needed was a pencil, the margins and some sticky notes. Reading expository texts can be broken into the following phases[^1]:

1. **Inspectional** - in this stage, you're skimming the text. The aim is to find out, at a high level, what the book can offer you and to formulate the questions you have. Your first pass reading is unlikely to be linear, and your second pass reading is likely to leave gaps in your understanding. It's also possible you skipped entire sections because it's not relevant to your learning yet.
2. **Analytical** - in this stage, you're ready to answer questions. You know what questions you have, and you're reading the book again with the intent to answer those questions.
3. **Syntopical** - in this stage, you've read the book many times and have a good idea of where to find the information you need when you need it. It's possible you may still have some outstanding questions from the previous stage (if not more), and you're not satisfied that this book answers all your questions. At this stage, you start to look for other sources of text to answer your remaining questions. You restart the cycle with the new text source and your questions/notes are formulated with references to the previous text.

All of these stages can be fulfilled with pen and paper.

## Questions
* What different types of digital media is there?
* How do you take notes effectively for each media?
* How do you reference notes across different media?
* How do you summarise your learnings from different media?

## Notes
* Because of the fact that digital media doesn't make it easy to write in the margins, or create references to other material, it becomes hard to read syntopically through web articles or e-books.
* Mention tools/techniques that could help achieve syntopic reading through digital media
* People can learn through more than just reading via digital media, so how can that be factored into learning?
* Different types of digital media
  * Structured courses
  * Articles - lends itself to syntopic reading
  * Videos
  * E-books
