It used to be a lot easier to learn when all we had were expostional texts. The type of media we could learn from were limited, and as a result, we didn't need to learn many ways of learning.

If you had a text book, all you needed was a pencil, the margins and some sticky notes. Reading expository texts can be broken into the following phases[^1]:

1. **Inspectional** - in this stage, you're skimming the text. The aim is to find out, at a high level, what the book can offer you and to formulate the questions you have. Your first pass reading is unlikely to be linear, and your second pass reading is likely to leave gaps in your understanding. It's also possible you skipped entire sections because it's not relevant to your learning yet.
2. **Analytical** - in this stage, you're ready to answer questions. You know what questions you have, and you're reading the book again with the intent to answer those questions.
3. **Syntopical** - in this stage, you've read the book many times and have a good idea of where to find the information you need when you need it. It's possible you may still have some outstanding questions from the previous stage (if not more), and you're not satisfied that this book answers all your questions. At this stage, you start to look for other sources of text to answer your remaining questions. You restart the cycle with the new text source and your questions/notes are formulated with references to the previous text.

All of these stages can be fulfilled with pen and paper.

## Questions
* What different types of digital media is there?
* How do you take notes effectively for each media?
* How do you reference notes across different media?
* How do you summarise your learnings from different media?

## Notes
* Because of the fact that digital media doesn't make it easy to write in the margins, or create references to other material, it becomes hard to read syntopically through web articles or e-books.
* Mention tools/techniques that could help achieve syntopic reading through digital media
* People can learn through more than just reading via digital media, so how can that be factored into learning?
* Different types of digital media
  * Structured courses
  * Articles - lends itself to syntopic reading
  * Videos
  * E-books
* One useful way I've found by learning is to create a markdown note structure with the following characteristics:
  * Header should reflect the aim of your learning
  * You have a references sub header that is a list of links or books you're going to or have read (make it clear which one you have and haven't read yet) - in order to mark a reference as read, you don't need to read the entire thing; just read it enough to get an answer to one of the questions
  * Each bullet point is a question you have relating to the header
  * Beneath each bullet point is an answer, but each answer must link to a reference
  * In your browser, you can open all the articles you plan on reading and close it after you have read it/got an answer you were looking for from it - whenever you open a new tab, ask yourself why you opened it. Once you have that question, add it to your list of questions. If you found the answer from the new tab, add it to your references and close it. If not, close it and don't add it to your references.
  * A good example of where I applied this is in the `notes` repo under `notes/tmp-interview-prep.md`
