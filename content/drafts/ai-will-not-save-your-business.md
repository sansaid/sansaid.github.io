* Businesses laying off seems to be tied to AI (see Discord post on 11/01/2024 on #tech-support)
* This is a flawed assumption
* Many businesses laying off to help with profitability
* So do you really believe that cutting down on AI will reduce your expenditure that much? <!-- QC1 -->
* Some businesses have a large chunk of its revenue in ads
* Many businesses don't want to admit this is a problem
* Relying on ads is a quick way to make money in lieu of a differentiating revenue stream
* Your business is then in the business of advertising - you're not a tech company, you're a marketing company
* So why is this so common?
* Tangibility - people are more reluctant to pay for digital content because it's not a physical product (anecdotal, but this is evidenced by friends exclaiming about me paying £4 for a movie on Prime, where as we easily pay £11 each to go to the cinema) <!-- QC2 -->
* If you're interested in making money from a product you're good at making, then we need to solve the problem of paying for tech
* Maybe one way of doing this is by making the payment invisible (if it's not real, then maybe pay for it "not real" currency) - look at how Gympass works, maybe we can do something similar
